                          Short Paths in CoAP
                   draft-amsuess-core-shopinc-latest

Abstract

   Applications built on CoAP face a conflict between the technical need
   for short message sizes and the interoperability requirement of
   following BCP190 and thus registering (relatively verbose) well-known
   URI paths.  This document intrduces an option that allows expressing
   well-known paths in as little as two bytes.

1.  Introduction

   [ This is a -00, please read the abstract. ]

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Short-Uri-Path option

   The Short-Uri-Path option expresses a request's URI path in a more
   compact form.

   The Short-Uri-Path option is a critical and safe-to-forward option
   for use in CoAP requests.  It uses an opaque value.  Its OSCORE
   treatment is as Class E ([RFC8613]).  These properties deviate from
   the Uri-Path for which it stands in in that this option is safe to
   forward.  This has unfortunate consequences for the interactions with
   the Proxy-URI option, but in the (wide-spread) absence of that
   option, it is desirable for this option to traverse proxies
   unhindered.

   The option is mutually exclusive with the Uri-Path option. receiving
   both in a single request is to be treated like the presence of a
   critical request option that could not be processed (that option
   being either the Short-Uri-Path option or the conflicting option).

   The Short-Uri-Path option SHOULD NOT be used in combination with the
   the Proxy-Uri option or the Proxy-CRI option (of
   [I-D.ietf-core-href]), but since a proxy unaware of this option might
   compose other Uri-* options into or decompose them out of the Proxy-
   CIR-like options, it is can occur together with them, provided those
   options' path is empty.  In this case, the Short-Uri-Path splices
   into the URI expressed in the other option.

   Any value of the Short-Uri-Path option represents a particular path,
   typically in the /.well-known/ hierarchy.  The values are managed in
   the Short-Uri-Path registry established in this document.

2.1.  Repeated use

   TBD: Later values expand as specified in the concrete registered
   item.

2.2.  Choice of the option number

   TBD: Rephrase this to either be useful for readers of the final
   document who can thus learn how the option number namespaced is
   managed, or remove before publication.

      It's already 1+1 -- we generally do try to keep even the 1+1 high
      so that later option typically paired with a low option (like
      EDHOC paired with OSCORE) can use the small delta.  In this case,
      there's a good reason (being ordered before Uri-Query) though, and
      I don't expect that any other option would need this particular
      property (expecially given that this option on its own has an
      extensible value range).

3.  Initial options

   This document registers values for the following well-known URIs:

   *  /.well-known/core

   *  /.well-known/rd (see [RFC9175])

   TBD: Ask BRSKI for a description

   For none of these, the repeated use of the option is specified; note
   that both are commonly used with Uri-Query options.

4.  Further development

   Several possible further directions are anticipated in this document,
   but not specified at this point in time; they are left for further
   documents:

   *  The mechanism of expanding one option into another option might be
      expressed using the terminology of SCHC.

      Such a generalization is not aimed for in this document; authors
      of any future document providing such a framework are encouraged
      to provide an equivalent but machine-readable explanation of the
      mechanism specified here.

   *  The registry for Short-Uri-Path values is set up such that first
      values can not have the most significant bit of the first byte
      set.

      This allows future documents to reuse the option for any CBOR
      expressions, e.g. the path component of a CRI
      [I-D.ietf-core-href].  Note that those CBOR strucutres can only
      use the major types 4 to 7 for the top-level item, but that
      includes all containers (arrays, maps and tags).

      Senders and recipients of this option do not need to concern
      themselves with that extension mechanism unless they implement it:
      As the first value is an opaque value compared to known registry
      entries, any CBOR item contained in it will simply not match any
      known value.  Should the working group decide not to use that
      exension point, the registry's policy can be relaxed to also allow
      values with that leading bit set.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  Open questions

   *  Do we want to enable the use of Uri-Query with this option?

      If so, we need option number 13, or put what the author regards as
      unreasonable requirements on recipients.

      In particular, the .well-known/core resource that is attractive
      for compression is commonly used with Uri-Query options, and it
      also works well for /.well-known/rd.

      The alternative is to use a higher number (still 1+1 but less
      precious), eg. 267.

   *  This document might incentivise users to send more traffic through
      /.well-known/ paths, rather than go through discovery.  It is up
      to WG discussion to decide whether this is desirable; to not make
      this document depend on that outcome, the registration policy is
      currently "IETF Review", which is extremely strict and can be
      relaxed in a later document if the WG decides so.

   *  Do we want to add /.well-known/edhoc here, or rather fix it by
      updating the EDHOC option to also work without an OSCOORE option?

      (The author prefers the latter).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  CoAP option: Short-Uri-Path

   IANA is requested to enter an one option into the CoAP Option Numbers
   registry in the CoRE Parameters group:

   *  Number: TBD13

   *  Name: Short-Uri-Path

   *  Reference: this document

7.2.  Short-Uri-Path registry

   IANA is requested to establish a new registry in the CoRE parameters
   group.

   Entry fields are:

   *  First option value.

      An arbitrary length byte sequence given in hexadecimal format;
      this value needs to be unique within this registry.

      The most significant bit of the first byte can not be 1.

   *  Simple expanded path.

      This text is the URI path (starting with /) that the option, when
      present only once in a request, is expanded to.

      This field may be empty if the document describes that the option
      needs to be repeated when using this first value.

   *  Reference.

      A document that requested the allocation, and describes whether
      the option may be repeated after this first value, and how later
      values are expanded

   Reviewer instructions:

   The reviewer is instructed to be frugal with the 128 single-byte
   values, focusing on applications that are expected to be useful in
   different constrained ecossystems.

   The expanded path (or paths) are expected to be well-known paths at
   the time of writing, but it is up to the reviewers to exceptionally
   also admit paths that are not well-known.

7.2.1.  Initial values

7.3.  First option value | Simple expanded path | Reference

   (empty) | /.well-known/core | this document 00 | /.well-known/rd |
